# 1) Linear Regression 
Linear regression is a fundamental statistical modeling technique used to understand the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to establish a linear equation that best represents the pattern of the data. The method assumes a linear association between the variables, meaning that as the independent variable changes, the dependent variable changes in a straight-line manner. Linear regression calculates the coefficients of the equation, representing the slope and intercept, which determine the line's position and steepness. By fitting the data points to the line, it allows for making predictions or drawing inferences about the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables. Linear regression is widely applied in various fields, including economics, social sciences, finance, and machine learning, providing a simple yet powerful tool for analyzing and interpreting data.
# 2) Logistic Regression 
Logistic Regression is a fundamental and widely employed classification algorithm in machine learning and statistics. It is particularly suited for binary classification tasks, where the objective is to predict one of two possible outcomes based on input features. The algorithm utilizes the sigmoid function to transform predicted values into probabilities, mapping them between 0 and 1. With a probability interpretation, instances are classified into one of the two classes based on a threshold, typically set at 0.5. Logistic Regression optimizes its parameters through iterative optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent, minimizing the logarithmic loss to fit the model to the data. This approach offers a straightforward implementation and interpretability, making it a popular choice for various applications. However, it may not handle complex nonlinear relationships well, and its sensitivity to outliers should be taken into account. Despite these limitations, logistic regression remains a valuable and efficient tool, especially when dealing with relatively simple classification problems or when model interpretability is a priority.
