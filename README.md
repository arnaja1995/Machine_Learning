# 1) Linear Regression 
Linear regression is a fundamental statistical modeling technique used to understand the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to establish a linear equation that best represents the pattern of the data. The method assumes a linear association between the variables, meaning that as the independent variable changes, the dependent variable changes in a straight-line manner. Linear regression calculates the coefficients of the equation, representing the slope and intercept, which determine the line's position and steepness. By fitting the data points to the line, it allows for making predictions or drawing inferences about the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables. Linear regression is widely applied in various fields, including economics, social sciences, finance, and machine learning, providing a simple yet powerful tool for analyzing and interpreting data.
